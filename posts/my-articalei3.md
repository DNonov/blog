Following is a review of my new favorite mechanical keyboard.  Post content
quality notwithstanding, you can see that only item in common between the two

rather not explicitly define the slug this way, you must then instead ensure
that the translated article titles are identical, since the slug will be
auto-generated from the article title.

this is extra space
